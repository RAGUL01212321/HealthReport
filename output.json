You \nwere admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely \nthat this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from \nyour cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid \nwas removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to \nhave a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came \ndown with treatment but this should continue to be followed as \nan outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a \nrepresentative from hospice. Because of your repeated \nparacenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex \ncatheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice \ncoordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.\n\nWe wish you all the best!\n\nYour ___ care team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

MRI is \nmore sensitive for evaluation of metastases.\n\nLeft hip XR (___):\nNo definite lytic lesion; however, an MRI can be performed to \nevaluate for an osseous lesion if indicated.\n\nPortable abdomen (___):\nRadiographs of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a \nnonobstructed\nbowel gas pattern.  A relative paucity of bowel gas is present \nin the upper and mid abdomen, likely due to marked enlargement \nof the liver, displacing bowel loops.  Note that the upright \nview is technically suboptimal, and limits evaluation for free \nintraperitoneal air.  If free intraperitoneal air is suspected \nclinically, a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen would \nbe recommended.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, \nincluding lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially \npresented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening \nintrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous \nliver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon \ncancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and \neventually discharged home with hospice.\n\nActive Issues:\n(1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary \nembolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission \ndemonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic \ncancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which \nhad evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient \nreluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy \nultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following \ndiscussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was \ntransferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential \ntrial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional \nand nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with \nthe patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus \ngoals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient \nwas discharged home with home hospice. \n\n(2) Left thigh weakness/spinous tenderness: She was found to \nhave focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse \nspinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of \npreserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted \nto be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying \nmalignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord \ninvolvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural \nabscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic \ncoverage with vancomycin/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite \nfrequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at \nlumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing \nclaustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable.\n\n(3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain \nand tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for \nobstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, \nparticularly given episodes of emesis/hematemesis as below. \nWhile multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen \nwas planned to evaluate for alternative sources of \nintraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple \noccasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol \nas needed.\n\n(4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small \nvolume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with \nblood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit \nremained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for \ngastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of \nPPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was \ntrue blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. \nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of \nrecurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. \n\n(5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered \nthroughout admission, never oriented to more than person and \nplace, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as \ncompared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including \nblood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent \nCXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for \nacute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion \nof metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia/MRI \naversion as above.  ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. \nHistory of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible \ncontributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. \nHepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic \nlesions to liver and asterixis on exam.  AMS could also be ___ \nto severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained \nstable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge.\n\n(6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset \nshortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was \nnegative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could \nnot be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal \ninfiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against \nacute coronary syndrome.  Low voltages on EKG were consistent \nwith prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. \nShortness of breath resolved over the course of admission \nwithout dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers \nand expectorants as needed.\n\n(7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked \nat 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting \nunderlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up \nincluding CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was \nunrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of \nisolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. \n\n(8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ \nto ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin \n2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. \nRight upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis \nor obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed \nintraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded \nin the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she \ndeclined CT for further evaluation.\n\n(9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout \nadmission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting \ncompromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant \ninfiltration. \n\n(10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic \n100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO \nintake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. \nTachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite \nconcurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear \ninfectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental \npulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of \nadmission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she \nwas never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of \nactive bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as \nabove.\n\n(11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and \nseeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying \ndepression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and \ntreatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal \nideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly \nprior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held \npreprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was \nseen by social work throughout admission.\n\n(12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and \nconsistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout \nadmission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the \nbasis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with \nthe exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active \nbleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above.\n\n(13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect \nsynthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of \nmalignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of \nactive bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as \nabove.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n-Patient discharge home with home hospice\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

As you know, you were \nadmitted for shortness of breath, likely due to your underlying \ncancer, and there was no evidence of pneumonia or blood clot in \nthe blood vessels of your lungs. Your shortness of breath \nresolved, but you were found to have weakness in your left thigh \nand abdominal pain. You declined imaging studies for further \ninvestigation of these findings. You underwent biopsy of your \nliver that revealed that the cancer known to affect your liver \nand lungs originated in your colon (large bowel). You were \ntransferred to the oncology service, but unfortunately \nchemotherapy would do more harm for you than good.  After a long \ndiscussion with you and your health care proxy, it was decided \nthat you will go home to be with your family and loved ones.  We \nwill also set up hospice services for you so that they can help \nwith any issues that arise while you are at home.  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"

Since the previous tracing of ___ \natrial premature beats are not seen. The Q-T interval is \nshorter. ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.  \n \nCXR ___:\nPA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. \nTiny bilateral pleural effusions are new since ___. No \nsigns of pneumonia or pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart is \ntop normal in size though this is stable. Aorta is markedly \ntortuous, unchanged. Aortic arch calcifications are seen. There \nis no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation. Partially imaged \nupper abdomen is unremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: Tiny pleural effusions, new. Otherwise unremarkable.\n\nECHO ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial \npressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity \nsize and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF \n>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are \nnormal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch \nlevels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully \nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nstructurally normal. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of \nmild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate \n[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate \npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic \npulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting \npulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior \nspace which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular \ncavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular \nsystolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild-moderate \nmitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. \nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the \nseverity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased and \nmoderate PA hypertension is now identified.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ woman with h/o hypertension, hypelipidemia, diabetes \nmellitus on insulin, cerebellar-medullary stroke in ___, \nstage ___ CKD followed by Dr ___ presenting with fatigue and \nDOE for a few weeks, markedly worse the morning of admission. \nThe patient has known diastolic dysfunction. Of note, she has \nbeen noncompliant with her medications at home. On arrival to \nthe floor, she required hydralazine 20 mg to bring down her BP. \nShe has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is \ncontributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand \nmyonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated \ntroponin.\n\n# CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, \npatient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. \nHer only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs \nattributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin \nfell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting \nof renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to \nsuggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. \nShe was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for \nevidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to \n81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her \nLDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from \nsimvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues \nwith drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover \natorvastatin. She was therefore switched to pravastatin 80 mg at \ndischarge. From a cardiac standpoint, we did not feel that \nPlavix was necessary for CAD, but her neurologist was contacted \nand wanted Plavix continued. We had to stop metoprolol due to HR \nin the ___ during admission even off metoprolol.\n  \n# Pump: Last echo in ___ showed low normal LVEF. Her current \npresentation was consistent with CHF exacerbation with bilateral \npleural effusions, dyspnea, and elevated NT-Pro-BNP. Her TTE \nshowed mild-moderate mitral and moderate tricuspid \nregurgitation, LVEF 50-55%, and pulmonary hypertension. We \nchanged her HCTZ to Lasix 40 mg PO at discharge. This medication \ncan be uptitrated as needed.\n\n# Hypertension: The patient's nephrologist, Dr. ___, agreed \nwith our proposed medication adjustments, but recommended \nstaying away from clonidine. There has been a H/O medication \nnon-adherence. Social work was involved in discharge planning, \nand ___ will be assisting the patient at home. We added \nlisinopril 20 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily and continued \nnifedipine 120 mg daily. Her atenolol was stopped due to her \nrenal dysfunction, but her metoprolol had to be stopped due to \nbradycardia. She should continue on once a day medication dosing \nto help with compliance.\n\n# ? COPD: The patient may have a component of COPD as she was \nwheezing on admission and responded to albuterol. She was given \na prescription for albuterol prn.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- She will be scheduled for outpt stress stress test\n- She has follow-up appointments with Dr. ___ and Dr. \n___ and both can work on uptitrating her BP \nmeds as needed.\n- ___ will need to work with patient on medication compliance.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nATENOLOL - 100 mg Tablet - 1.5 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day \nCLONIDINE - 0.1 mg/24 hour Patch Weekly - place on shoulder once \na week\nCLOPIDOGREL [PLAVIX] - 75 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once \na day generic is available preferable, please call Dr ___ \nan appointment  \nFENOFIBRATE MICRONIZED - 134 mg Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth \nonce a day\nHYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE - 25 mg Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth \nonce a day\nNIFEDIPINE [NIFEDIAC CC] - 60 mg Tablet Extended Release - 2 \nTablet(s) by mouth once a day\nNITROGLYCERIN [NITROSTAT] - 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual - 1 \nTablet(s) sublingually sl as needed for prn chest pain may use 3 \ndoses, 5 minutes apart; if no relief, ED visit \nRANITIDINE HCL - 300 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nSIMVASTATIN - 80 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime\n\nMedications - OTC  \nASPIRIN [ENTERIC COATED ASPIRIN] - 325 mg Tablet, Delayed \nRelease (E.C.) - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nINSULIN NPH & REGULAR HUMAN [HUMULIN 70/30] - 100 unit/mL \n(70-30) Suspension - 30 units at dinner at dinner\nMULTIVITAMIN - (OTC) - Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY \n(Daily).

The LMCA had no \nobstructive disease.  The LAD had a moderate disease in the mid \nartery and a diagonal branch had an 80% proximal lesion.  The \nLcx had a 70% proximal lesion.  The RCA was totally occluded \nmid-vessel. \n  \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. \n2. Recommend CABG evaluation\n\nCT CHEST: ___\n1.  Diffuse confluent ground-glass opacities predominantly in \nthe right upper lobe and right lower lobe most likely represent \nresidual pulmonary edema, localized to the right lung because of \ndirection of jet in mitral \nregurgitation.  \n2.  Possible pulmonary hypertension. \n3.  Moderate coronary artery disease. \n\nCAROTID US: ___\nNo evidence of hemodynamically significant internal carotid \nstenosis on either side. \n\nECHO ___- PCI)\nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal \ncavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. No \nmasses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no \nventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and \nfree wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. An eccentric jet of mild (1+) mitral \nregurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe LVEF has increased. The degree of MR seen has decreased. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ female with ___, HTN, diabetes, CKD presented with \nincreased dyspnea and non-productive cough without fevers or \nelevated white count, initially admitted to ___ with concern \nfor pneumonia. However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme \nleak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent \ncardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, \nlactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary \nedema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who \ntransferred the patient to cardiology floor.\n\n# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation/mitral regurgitation: \nLikely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in \nworsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior \nwall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac \ncath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically \nwith lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was \nconsulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair/replacement. \nHowever, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high \nrisk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made \nto revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient \nwould regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a \nbare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in \nthe diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her \nmitral regurgitation. \n\n# NSTEMI/CAD:\nAs evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was \nbriefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac \ncatheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed \n3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with \naspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As \nthe patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to \nthe cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA. She will \nrequire plavix for at least 1 month.\n\n# Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive. Continued \nnifedipine at half of her home dose. Continued on lisinopril. \nShe was also started on metoprolol as above for CHF.\n\n# Diabetes: Continued home insulin regime. \n \n# CKD stage IV: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.8 per renal notes. Currently \nat baseline. \n\n# History of CVA: Continued home aspirin and clopidogrel. \n\n# GERD: Continued home ranitidine.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n* Will need follow up with a cardiologist. Patient will be \nscheduled to follow up with the first available CMED \ncardiologist. \n* Will need plavix for at least one month (day of bare metal \nstent placement = ___.\n* Atorvastatin dose increased to 80mg (per pharmacy, her \ninsurance will cover. Her co-pay will be $10/month).\n* Consider titrating nifedipine dose back to 120mg if still \nhypertensive. \n* Please recheck Chem7 at next appointment to evaluate for ___ \nsecondary to dye received during cardiac catheterization.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

As you recall, you were admitted for shortness \nof breath. This was because one of your heart valves was weak, \nwhich caused fluid to build up in your lungs. Your heart valve \nwas weak because there was a blockage in one of your heart \narteries. You underwent a procedure, called cardiac \ncatheterization, which opened up the blocked arteries. Your \nvalve and heart are pumping much more efficiently now. We are \nglad you are feeling better. Please weigh yourself every \nmorning, and call your MD if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs \nover 24 hours.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"
